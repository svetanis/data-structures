# Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)
A comprehensive collection of optimized data structure implementations and algorithmic solutions. 
This repository serves as a technical reference for fundamental computer science concepts, 
focusing on time/space complexity and efficient memory management.
### Key Focus Areas:
* **Abstract Data Types:** Custom implementations of Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and Heaps.
* **Algorithm Patterns:** Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Backtracking, Sorting/Searching, and Greedy algorithms.
* **Optimization:** Multiple iterations of solutions, moving from brute-force to optimal time complexity.
* **Performance:** Analysis of Big O complexity for each implementation.
*This repository demonstrates a commitment to technical rigor and the underlying mechanics of high-performance backend systems.*
